    "Hierarchical clustering is a clustering technique used to create a hierarchy of clusters by iteratively merging or dividing existing clusters. It starts with each data point as its own cluster and progressively combines or separates clusters based on their similarity. The result is a tree-like structure called a dendrogram, which visually represents the relationships between data points and clusters at different levels of granularity. \n",
